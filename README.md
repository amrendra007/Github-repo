# GitHub-fav-repo

React js web App that allow to fetch popular repo.
Two different approach of this is available
Try importing app and app2.js in index.js

Like in one approach i have made all ajax req to github in componentDidMount n set state, clicking links render data this approach feels like smooth user experience but making some unnecessary ajax at first.

And in second approach, ajax req is made whenever user click link and according to that ui is updated, this is not good ux but it is not making unncessary ajax req
